     * Construct an Autonomous Command to perform the auto portion of the robot
     * game. This command will be built when the constructor is called and each
     * element of the command will execute in order.
     * <p>
     * When a parallel command is started, it will act at the same time as all other
     * parallel commands and the next serial command. Parallel commands can end
     * before the serial command, however, when the serial command is complete, all
     * parallel commands will be interrupted at that time if they have not already
     * finished.
     * <p>
     * Since the commands are all constructed at the same instant (when this
     * constructor is called), the commands should not read sensor information in
     * the constructor. All commands should read any relevant sensor information
     * (speed, heading, position) in the init() method of the command. The init()
     * method will be run when the command starts and so can get the robot
     * information at the start of the command, the constructor will be run
     * immediately when the Auto CommandGroup is constructed, and will not have the
     * sensor information relevant to when the command is run.
